              <h5>Game Summary</h5>
              <p>Wavelength is a social guessing game where two teams compete to read each other’s minds.
                Teams take turns rotating a dial to where they think a target is located along a spectrum 
                that’s hidden behind a screen. One player from the active team&mdash;the Psychic&mdash;knows where the 
                target is, but can only give a clue ON THE SPECTRUM between two opposing concepts. After 
                that, their teammates have to guess where the target is.
              </p>
              
              <h5>Setup Notes</h5>
              <p>
                Divide into 2 teams of roughly the same size. Then decide who on those teams will be the 
                Psychics (clue givers) for the first round. We call the teams Left Brain and Right Brain.
              </p>

              <h5>Psychic Phase</h5>
              <p>Each round begins with the current team’s Psychic drawing a wavelength card and giving 
                a clue ON THE SPECTRUM between the two concepts on the card. The Psychic should do this 
                secretly, so players on both teams can’t see where the target is. Here’s the order the Psychic
                should go in:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Choose a wavelength: Draw 1 wavelength card. Don’t think too hard about it: just pick 
                    the one you find most interesting! Read the card text so both teams can hear.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Peak at the screen: Using the PEAK button, peak and look at where the target is located 
                    while ALL players from both teams are looking away. Only you the Pyschic should see where the target it.
                    When you have memorised the target's location, click the PEAK button again to cover the screen
                    and allow all players to view the board again.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Give a clue: Look at where the target’s centre is located spatially along the visible 
                    area of the wheel. Now think of a clue that is conceptually where the target is located 
                    ON THE SPECTRUM between the two concepts on your card. Rules for how to give clues can be found below.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                Now the Psychic stops communicating ENTIRELY!

                After the Psychic has given their clue, they are no longer allowed to say ANYTHING&mdash;not even 
                clarifications&mdash;and must keep an entirely straight face. If a Psychic ever gives away the target 
                location after giving their clue, either verbally or nonverbally, it’s up to everyone playing 
                to decide whether to penalize the team. We tend to just let the Psychic give a new clue with a 
                new card and target location, but we’re generous that way.
              </p>

              <h5>Team Phase</h5>
              <p>
                After the Psychic gives their clue, it’s up to the rest of their team to READ THEIR MIND 
                and turn the dial as close to the center of the target area as they can. This is the core of the game 
                and it is almost entirely free of rules: teammates can discuss, debate, and argue in any way they like.
                After the Psychic’s team has come to an agreement, they let the other team know that they’ve finalised 
                their dial position.
              </p>

              <h5>Left/Right Phase</h5>
              <p>
                In Wavelength, BOTH teams always have a chance to score points from a clue. After the Psychic’s team 
                has finalised their dial position, the other team gets to guess whether the centre of the target is 
                to the left or right of the dial. This discussion should be fairly brief, since it’s a simple binary 
                choice: LEFT or RIGHT. The team makes their guess by placing the marker in either the LEFT or RIGHT 
                slot next to the wavelength card. For example, if the card was HOT|COLD and the team guessed LEFT, 
                it would indicate they think the Psychic meant to convey something MORE HOT than the current team guessed.
              </p>

              <h5>Scoring Phase</h5>
              <p>
                Once both teams have finalised their guesses, it’s time for the most exciting part of the game: THE REVEAL.
                The Psychic clicks the GUESS button in the centre of the dial to reveal the target. Their team scores points 
                if the dial is within the colored target area, as listed on the colored wedges (2-4 points). The other team 
                scores 1 point if they correctly guessed whether the target is to the left or right of the final dial position. 
                If the Psychic’s team guessed perfectly (the 4 point wedge), the other team cannot score.
              </p>

              <h5>How the Game Progresses</h5>
              <p>PSYCHIC PHASE: Current team’s Psychic gives clue. TEAM PHASE: Psychic’s team discusses and turns dial. 
                LEFT/RIGHT PHASE: Other team guesses left/right. SCORING: Psychic reveals target and points are given.
                Play continues like this, with teams take turns giving clues, with a new player being the Psychic each time.
              </p>

              <h5>Winning</h5>
              <p>
                Once a team has reached 10 points, the game ends—and the team with the highest score wins! If there’s a 
                tie, each team takes a final sudden death turn. The team that scores the most points that round wins 
                (including the LEFT/RIGHT guess). If there’s still a tie, repeat until a team has won.
              </p>

              <h5>Clue Giving Rules</h5>
              <p>
                Wavelength is all about wildly creative clues. So we tried to give players as much freedom as possible 
                to do that. These rules are here only to restrict clue giving methods that frequently broke the game&mdash;feel 
                free to adapt them to whatever works best for you and your friends.
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Convey a single thought: A clue shouldn’t combine multiple ideas or give a lot of explanatory context. 
                    Words like “AND,” “BUT,” “WHILE,” “WHO,” and “WHEN” are some- times OK, but not when they basically 
                    combine two clues together. A dead giveaway is a team debating one part of the clue, then debating 
                    the other part, and figuring out how to weigh both.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Don’t “invent” something: The clue must exist as a thing in the universe outside of you giving the clue. 
                    It can be fictional, just not something you’re making up exclusively for this situation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Be on topic: Your clue has to be related to the concepts on this round’s card. You aren’t allowed to 
                    use one side as a double meaning, e.g. “hot” meaning attractive.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Don’t use the words on the card or any synonyms: You can’t use words from the same “family” as those on the card.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    No numbers: You can’t use numbers, percentages, ratios, or anything numeric to sneakily suggest the location of the target.
                    If a number is in the proper name of a thing, that’s OK.
                  </li>
                </ol>
